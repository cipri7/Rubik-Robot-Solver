Explanation of Changes and Improvements:

ColorClassifier Enhancements: The ColorClassifier class now handles its own calibration data loading and saving, making it self-contained.
CubeScanner Class: This new class encapsulates all the camera handling and cube scanning logic. It uses the ColorClassifier to identify colors and provides a method to capture a single face, scan the entire cube, and build the cube string. It also implements __enter__ and __exit__ for proper resource management (camera release).
MotorController Class: This class manages the serial communication with the Arduino, sending the solution string and waiting for confirmation.
scan_cube.py Simplification: The scan_cube.py script is now responsible for high-level workflow: initializing the ColorClassifier, handling calibration, using the CubeScanner to scan the cube, and saving the scanned state.
visualize_cube.py Integration: The visualize_cube.py script now uses the MotorController to send the solution to the Arduino. It attempts to connect to the Arduino and disables the send functionality if the connection fails.
Modularity: The code is now more modular, with each class responsible for a specific task. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
Resource Management: The CubeScanner class uses a with statement to ensure that the camera is released properly, even if errors occur. The MotorController also handles connection and disconnection explicitly.
Error Handling: The MotorController includes error handling for serial communication, and the visualize_cube.py script handles potential errors when solving the cube.
This revised structure promotes better organization, reusability, and maintainability of the Rubik's Cube solver robot code.
